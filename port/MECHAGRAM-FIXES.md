# Mechagram revision 9

Display balances are shared by Settings, gift catalog/store, purchase/transfer and balance overlays. The actual server balances remain intact.

Remote message deletion retains previously cached cloud messages, including zero or unstarted autoremove timers; expired messages, disappearing media and secret chats follow their original lifecycle. History validation preserves retained messages. MechagramRetention logs contain reasons only, without message text or account identifiers.

Enable both visual balances and local gifts in Mechagram settings to simulate catalog/market gifts. The local transaction spends the DEMO balance and inserts a card with a DEMO notice without unsent/sending flags or network requests. Other devices cannot see local cards. Regular and collectible gifts are supported in private chats; real purchases remain separate.

CI compiles and runs 13 cases against the production retention and decimal spending policies before building the IPA. Device validation is still required.
